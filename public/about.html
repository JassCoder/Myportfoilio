                    <p>
                      I’m Jaspreet Singh — a creative technologist, animator, and entrepreneur who blends art, code, and strategy. I move between VFX, game development, and startup building with the same curiosity that got me into animation years ago.

                <h2>From where I am</h2>
                  <p>
                    Originally from India, now based in Zagreb, Croatia, working across Europe and exploring education and collaboration opportunities through the 42 Network (France, Austria, etc.).
                  </p>
              </li>

              <li class="list">
                  <h2>What I did</h2>
                    <p>I’ve spent the last few years working in CGI and VFX, building real-time projects with Houdini, Blender, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Along the way, I launched ventures in digital     media, import-export, and social platforms — turning ideas into structured businesses with real revenue models.

                    </p>
              </li>

              <li class="list">
                <h2>What I want to do</h2>
                  <p>My next goal is to merge my creative and technical skills into software engineering and machine-learning projects — building tools, apps, and scalable systems that connect creativity and tech. I’m working toward becoming a software architect, mastering full-stack development, and shaping products that make design, media, and data smarter and more human.
